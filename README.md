# ML Practice: Basic Data Preprocessing & Machine Learning in Python

This project was created to **practice basic data preprocessing and machine learning tasks in Python**.

### 🔍 What I practiced:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Splitting data into training and testing sets
- Training a simple ML model (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)
- Evaluating model performance

### 📁 Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

### 💡 Purpose:
To strengthen my understanding of the typical steps involved in preparing a dataset and applying basic machine learning models using Python.
